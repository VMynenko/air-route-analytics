# US Airline Flight Routes and Fares Analytics

This is my final project for Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025.

## Problem Description

This dashboard analyzes historical USA airline flight route data, containing details on pricing, carriers, and origin/destination pairs across different years. The visualizations aim to address the following key questions about the air travel market:

- How has the average airfare evolved over the years?

- Which origin cities offer the widest range of direct connections (measured by the percentage of unique destinations reached relative to all destinations)?

- Which destination cities are accessible from the broadest set of origin points (measured by the percentage of unique origins served relative to all origins)?

- How do pricing trends and connectivity metrics differ when analyzing specific origin-destination pairs or individual cities using the provided filters?
